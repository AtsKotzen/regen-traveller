## Technologies Used

- **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js):** The project is built using the MERN stack, which combines MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the backend framework, React for the frontend, and Node.js for server-side scripting. This powerful combination allows for efficient development, scalability, and real-time data handling.

- **Tailwind CSS:** The website's UI is designed using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-designed utility classes that make it easy to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

- **JavaScript:** The project utilizes JavaScript as the primary programming language for both frontend and backend development. JavaScript provides the necessary functionality for interactivity, data manipulation, and asynchronous operations.
